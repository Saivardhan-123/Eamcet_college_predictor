# EAMCET College Predictor - Deployment Fix

## Issue Fixed

The ML model deployment was failing on Render with the error:

```
❌ Error loading eamcet_rank_model_deployable.joblib: list indices must be integers or slices, not str
⚠️ No ML model found. Run updated_training_data.py to train an improved model.
```

## Root Cause

The issue was caused by a mismatch in the model file structure. The `eamcet_rank_model_deployable.joblib` file contained a direct `RandomForestRegressor` object, but the `load_model` method in `ml_rank_predictor.py` expected a dictionary structure with specific keys.

## Solution

1. Updated the `load_model` method in `ml_rank_predictor.py` to handle both formats:
   - Direct model objects (like RandomForestRegressor)
   - Dictionary-wrapped models with metadata

2. Updated the `predict_rank` method to work with both model formats and properly handle feature names.

3. Created a properly structured model file with the required fields:
   - `best_model`: The actual RandomForestRegressor model
   - `best_model_name`: The name of the model ('random_forest')
   - `version`: Version information ('deployable_v1.0')
   - `timestamp`: When the model was created
   - `feature_names`: The feature names used by the model
   - `scaler`: Set to None since this model doesn't use a scaler

## Files Modified

1. `ml_rank_predictor.py` - Updated to handle different model formats
2. `eamcet_rank_model_deployable.joblib` - Restructured to be compatible with the code

## Deployment Instructions

The fixed model file is now compatible with Render deployment. You can deploy the application using the standard Render deployment process:

1. Push the changes to your GitHub repository
2. Connect your Render account to your GitHub repository
3. Create a new Web Service in Render, pointing to your repository
4. Use the settings from `render.yaml` for configuration

## Verification

The application has been tested locally and confirms that:

1. The model loads successfully
2. The application runs without errors
3. The model can make predictions correctly

This fix ensures that the model will load correctly on Render's deployment environment.
